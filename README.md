# isel-leic-notes üóíÔ∏è

> This repo contains some notes from the subjects of my degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering), at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/).

* The **only purpose** of these notes is to share the knowledge and notes that I have acquired in the course;
* Some notes are written in Portuguese and some in English, but a future goal is to have a version in both languages;
* The notes are only a **summary** of the subjects, and they are not intended to be a substitute for the official course material;
* I am not responsible for any errors or omissions in the notes;
* If you find any errors or omissions, please open an issue or a pull request;
* If you want to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request.
