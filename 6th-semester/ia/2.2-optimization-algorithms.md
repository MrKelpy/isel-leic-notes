# Optimization Algorithms

> Optimization is the problem of finding a set of inputs to an objective function that results in a maximum or minimum function evaluation. It is the challenging problem that underlies many machine learning algorithms, from fitting logistic regression models to training artificial neural networks.

### Optimization methods

* **Exact methods** - methods that guarantee to find the **optimal solution**; e.g. A*, constraint programming, branch and bound, dynamic programming, etc.
* **Approximate methods** - methods that find a solution that is **close to the optimal solution**; e.g. meta-heuristics, hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, etc.
