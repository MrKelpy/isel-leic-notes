# RPC - Remote Procedure Call

> **RPC** (**Remote Procedure Call**) is a **protocol** that **allows** a **computer program** to **call** a **procedure** that **resides** in **another address space** (**computer** on a **different** **host**), which is **encoded** as **data** in **binary** form (**message**) and is **transmitted** to the **remote** **address space** to **be executed** there as a **procedure call**.

* The client and the server communicate through **stubs**;
* The two stubs communicate through the network.

## [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)

> **gRPC** is a **modern** **open source** **high performance** **RPC** **framework** that can run in **any environment**.

* Uses **HTTP/2** as the transport protocol;
* **Protobuf** as the interface definition language;
* The contract compiler generates **client** and **server** **stubs** in **many languages**;

There are 4 types of calls:

1. **Unary** - **one request** and **one response**;
2. **Server streaming** - **one request** and **many responses**;
3. **Client streaming** - **many requests** and **one response**;
4. **Bidirectional streaming** - **many requests** and **many responses** (the number of requests and responses can be different).

> ### HTTP/2
>
> **HTTP/2** is a **major revision** of the **HTTP** network protocol used
> by the **World Wide Web**.
>
> * **Binary** instead of **text**;
> * Header compression;
> * Low latency;
> * Allows **multiplexing**, which means that **multiple requests** can be
> **in flight** at the same time, using the same **TCP connection** (instead
> of opening a new connection for each request - **HTTP/1.1**);

### [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/)

> The service contract is defined using **Protocol Buffers** (Protobuf), a **language-neutral**, **platform-neutral**, **extensible** mechanism for **serializing** structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.

* There are plugins to compile the `.proto` files to **Java**, **C#** and other languages;
* Example of a service:
  
```protobuf
service Calculator {
  rpc add(Request) returns (Reply);
}

message Request {
  double op1 = 1;
  double op2 = 2;
}

message Reply {
  double res = 1;
}
```

Types of calls:

1. **Unary** - `rpc oper(Request) returns (Reply)`
2. **Server streaming** - `rpc oper(Request) returns (stream Reply)`
3. **Client streaming** - `rpc oper(stream Request) returns (Reply)`
4. **Bidirectional streaming** - `rpc oper(stream Request) returns (stream Reply)`

### StreamObserver Interface

> The **StreamObserver** interface is used to **send** and **receive** messages, using the **observer pattern**:

```java
public interface StreamObserver<T> {
  void onNext(T value);
  void onError(Throwable t);
  void onCompleted();
}
```

* `onNext()` - send one more message to the stream;
* `onError()` - send an error to the stream;
* `onCompleted()` - send a completion signal to the stream, indicating that no more messages will be sent.

<!--TODO: Maybe add examples of implementation in Java-->

> **Note**: The `onError` receives a `Throwable` object, which can be used to send an error message to the client. The gRPC provides specific exceptions for each error type, such as `StatusRuntimeException` and `StatusException`. Other exceptions will not be sent to the client, being UNKNOWN instead.

### Client Stubs

> The **client stub** is a **local proxy** that **encodes** and **transmits** a method call, **waits** for a response, and **decodes** the response back into a **Java object**.

The client stub can be:

* **Blocking** - the client makes a **synchronous** call to the server, and **waits** for the response;
  * Only **unary** and **server streaming** calls are supported;
* **Future** - the client makes an **asynchronous** call to the server, and **waits** for the response;
  * Only **unary** calls are supported;
* **Async (Non-blocking)** - the client makes an **asynchronous** call to the server, and **registers** a **callback** to be **invoked** when the response is received.

| Call type               | Blocking           | Future             | Async              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Unary                   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Server streaming        | :white_check_mark: | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |
| Client streaming        | :x:                | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |
| Bidirectional streaming | :x:                | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |
