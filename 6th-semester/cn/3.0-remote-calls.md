# Remote Calls

> There are multiple ways (middlewares) to implement remote calls in distributed systems:
>
> * **Sockets TCP/IP**
> * **Remote Method Invocation (RMI) - Java RMI**
> * **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) - Google RPC (gRPC)**

## Sockets TCP/IP

* **TCP** is a **connection oriented** protocol that allows two hosts to establish a connection and exchange **streams** of data;
  * One host is the **client** and the other is the **server**;
  * The server is always listening for connections and the client initiates the connection;
* Once the connection is established, the client and server can exchange data, in a **reliable** way, through streams in **both directions**, until the connection is closed;
* To allow the existence of multiple connections, `(IP, port)` pairs are used to identify the connections;

| Primitive          | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `socket()`         | Creates a socket                                   |
| `bind()`           | Binds a socket to a pair `(IP, port)`              |
| `listen()`         | Puts the socket in listening mode                  |
| `accept()`         | Blocks until a connection is established           |
| `connect()`        | Establishes a connection to a server               |
| `send()`/`write()` | Sends data to the other end of the connection      |
| `recv()`/`read()`  | Receives data from the other end of the connection |
| `close()`          | Closes the socket                                  |

> **Note**: In Java, the `Socket` class represents a socket and the `ServerSocket` class represents a server socket. This classes are implemented in the `java.net` package.

Other useful classes:

* `InetSocketAddress` - Represents a socket address (IP address + port number) for the `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes;
* `BufferedReader` - Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines;
* `PrintWriter` - Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.


### Conclusions

* The concurrency in the server must be explicit, and handled by the programmer;
* The protocol to exchange data depend on the stream of data, and implies the use of a **serialization** mechanism, like **XML** or **JSON**;
* Due to the existence of other middlewares with higher abstraction levels, this approach is not very common nowadays.
