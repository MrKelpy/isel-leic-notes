# Pitch an Idea

* A good pitch balances **business and emotional needs**;
* A good pitch is **succinct**;
* A good pitch **tells a story**;
* A good pitch **focuses on benefits**;
* A good pitch is **short** (10-20 slides);

### How to make your pitch stand out?

* Create a **beautiful and powerful presentation**;
* Make your pitch **visually exciting**;
* A **succinct**, **entertaining**, and **informative** video showcasing how your product solves the challenges;
* Start off with a bang to grab your viewer’s attention - the **first two slides need to quickly get them engaged**.

### What a pitch should include?

* **Problem**: What is the problem you are solving? What is the pain point? What is the opportunity?
  * Here’s where the storytelling starts;
  * You’re establishing the status quo and convincing your audience that there’s a real problem here that you can solve;
  * Remember all the research you did on understanding their needs, motivations, and challenges here. 
  * Ideally, you’ll present the ‘problem’ in 1-4 bullet point - **Get to the point quickly**.

* **Solution**: What is your solution? How does it solve the problem? How does it create value?
  * List the 3 key benefits your solution provides.

* The **Market**: Who is your target market? What is the size of the market? What is the growth rate?
  * Just how many people need your solution? 
  * Here is where you’ll talk about the real addressable market for your product and what percentage of the market you’re looking to dominate.

### What makes you truly unique?

* **Competition**: Who are your competitors? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How are you different?
  * What are the key differentiators that make your product stand out from the competition?
  * What are the key features that make your product unique?
* **Proprietary technology**: What are your advantages, IP, technologies and innovations that are unique to your company, and will KO the competition?

### Explain who you are

* Quickly **introduce the core team**, or if it’s just you, talk about yourself;
* What makes you the best person to do all the things you’ve just said you’re going to do?
* Show all the skills your team has and how they complement each other.

### Questions

* The pitch doesn’t stop after your last slide;
* If all goes well, you’ll be facing **questions and comments** from investors and customers eager to get on board with what you’re selling;
* So, as part of your pitch preparation, you need to be ready for **questions, objections and pullbacks**.

### Prepare yourself

* **Confidence** is key when it comes to pitching;
* Before you step on any stage or into any office with your presentation **you should know it front to back**. Try it out on your co-workers. On your partner. On your parents;
* And when you’re practicing at home, **speak out loud**. Record yourself presenting and play it back.
