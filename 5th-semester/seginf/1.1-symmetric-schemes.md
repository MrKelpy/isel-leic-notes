# Symmetric Schemes

* Process of **protection** and **deprotection** uses the **same key**;
* **Keys** are usually used during a **short period** of time;
* Keys are established after a **negotiation process** between who encrypts and who decrypts;
* Used in:
  * **Symmetric cipher**;
  * **MAC**.

## Symmetric Cipher

<!--Add image-->

Algorithms `(G, E, D)`:
* `G` - **probabilistic** function for **key generation**;
  * `G :-> Keys`;
* `E` - **probabilistic** function for cipher;
  * `E: Keys -> {0, 1}* -> {0, 1}*`;
* `D` - **deterministic** function for decipher;
  * `D: Keys -> {0, 1}* -> {0, 1}*`. 

<!--Add image-->

### Properties

* **Correção property**: `Keys: D(k)(E(k)(m)) = m`;
* **Security property**: is computationally **infeasible** to **find `m`** (plain text) **from `c`** (ciphered text), without knowing the **key `k`**;
* **Symmetric scheme**: use of the **same key `k`** in the functions `E` and `D`;
* Message `m` and ciphered text `c` are **byte sequences** with **variable dimension** (`{0,1}*`);
* **Does not guarantee data integrity**;
* Examples: DES-CBC-PKCS5Padding, AES-CBC-PKCS5Padding, etc.

## MAC (Message Authentication Code) Scheme

<!--Add image-->

Algorithms `(G, T, V)`:
* `G` - **probabilistic** function for **key generation**;
  * `G :-> Keys`;
* `T` - **probabilistic** function for **tag generation**;
  * `T: Keys -> {0, 1}* -> Tags`;
* `V` - **deterministic** function for **tag verification**;
  * `V: Keys -> ( Tags x {0, 1}* ) -> {true, false}`.

<!--Add image-->

### Properties 

* **Correção property**: `Keys: V(k)(T(k)(m), m) = true`;
* **Security property**: is computationally **infeasible** to **find `m`** (plain text) **from `t`** (**tag**), without knowing the **key `k`**;
* **Symmetric Scheme**: use of the **same key `k`** in the functions `T` and `V`;
* Message `m` and tag `t` are **byte sequences** with **variable dimension** (`{0,1}*`);
* Tag `t` has **fixed dimension** (e.g. 160, 256 bits);
* Code detectors and error correctors do not serve for MAC schemes;
* Examples: HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, etc.

## Symmetric Cipher Primitives

* To use symmetric cipher schemes, we need to choose a **symmetric cipher primitive**;
* Examples: DES, AES, Blowfish, etc;
* Block cipher primitive:
  * `n` - block dimension;
  * `l` - key dimension;
  * Function `E`: `{0, 1}^l -> {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1}^n`;
  * Function `D`: `{0, 1}^l -> {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1}^n`.

### Features

* The block dimension `n` must be **sufficiently high** to prevent attacks based on the **statistics of the plain text**;
* The key dimension `l` must be **sufficiently high** to prevent attacks based on **brute force**.

## Operation Modes

* Plain text **patterns should not be evident** in the ciphered text;
* The efficiency of the used method should be **higher** than the **efficiency of the cipher primitive**;
* Ciphered text **dimension should be approximately equal** to plain text dimension;
* The decipher should be capable of **error detection and correction**;
* **Random access** - ability to decipher and change **only part** of the ciphered text.

### ECB (Electronic Code Book) Mode

<!--Add image-->

* Plain text blocks **equal**, ciphered with the **same key**, imply ciphered text blocks **equal**;
* **Interdependence in the cipher** - The cipher is performed **independently** in each block;
* **Error propagation** - Error occurrence in a ciphered text block **affects only** the decipher of that block;
* **Random access**.

---

### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) Mode

<!--Add image-->

* Under the same key and under the **same initialization vector (IV)**, two equal messages imply equal ciphered texts;
* **Interdependence in the cipher** - The cipher is performed **independently** in each block;
* **Error propagation** - Error occurrence in a ciphered text block `cj` **affects** the decipher of that block and the next block `cj+1`;
  * The decipher of the block `cj+1` will have errors in the **same positions** as the block `cj`;
* **Reordering** the ciphered text blocks **affects** the decipher;
* It is relatively **easy to manipulate** a given plain text block.

#### IV - Initialization Vector

* Should be **stored and transmitted in plain**;
* Should not be reused - **uniqueness**;
* Should not be predictable - **unpredictability**.

## Padding

* *Padding is a way to take data that may or may not be a multiple of the block size for a cipher and extend it out so that it is;*
* `X` is the **bytes count to add** to the message dimension to make it a **multiple of the block** dimension;
* Example: `PKCS#5` and `PKCS#7` padding.

## Stream Operation Modes

Modes like CBC need different algorithms to cipher and decipher.

### CTR (Counter) Mode

<!--Add image-->

* Under the same key and under the **same initialization vector (IV)**, two equal messages imply equal ciphered texts;
* **Error propagation** - Error occurrence in a ciphered text block `cj` **affects only** the decipher of that block;
  * The decipher of the block `cj` will have errors in the **same positions** as the block `cj`;
* **Random access**;
* It is relatively **easy to manipulate** a given plain text block.

## Authenticated Cipher

* To guarantee **confidentiality and simultaneously authenticity**, it is necessary to use a combination of the **Cipher and MAC schemes**;
* There are two approaches:
  * **Encrypt-then-MAC** - The tag indicates whether there was a change or not in the ciphered text;
  * **MAC-then-Encrypt** - The tag is generated over the message, and is then all encrypted;
* There are operation modes whose objective is to **produce an authenticated cipher** by combining the operations in a single algorithm:
  * Galois/Counter Mode (GCM);
  * Offset Codebook Mode (OCB);
  * Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM).
