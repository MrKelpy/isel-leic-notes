# Cryptography

> Cryptography is the science of encoding information.

## Cryptographic Mechanisms

* **Primitives**:
  * mathematical operations used as **building blocks** in the realization of schemes;
  * e.g. DES, AES, RSA, ECC, etc;
* **Schemes**:
  * **combination of primitives** and additional methods for the realization of cryptographic tasks such as cipher and digital signature;
  * e.g. DES-CBC-PKCS5Padding, RSA-OAEP, etc;
* **Protocols**:
  * **sequences of operations** performed by one or more entities, involving **schemes and primitives**;
  * e.g. TLS, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, etc.

## Scheme Types

Schemes can be classified in two main groups:

### Symmetric Schemes

* **Cypher** and **authentication**;
* **Secret key used by both parties (cipher and decipher)**;
* Used to **generate and verify the MAC**;
* e.g. DES, AES, etc;
* Faster, but not so safe;

### Asymmetric Schemes

* **Cypher** and **digital signature**;
* **Public key to cipher and private key to decipher**;
* Cypher schemes - "Everyone can cipher, only the receiver can decipher";
* Authentication schemes - "Everyone can verify, only the authorized sender can sign";
* Safer, but slower;
