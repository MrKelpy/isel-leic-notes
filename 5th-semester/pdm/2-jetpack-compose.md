# [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

> *Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.*

* A composable function is a **function that describes how to lay out and draw** one screen of your app;
* A composable function is any function annotated with the `@Composable` annotation;
* A composable function only can be called from **another** composable function;

## Elementary Composables

* `Text` - displays text;
* `Button` - displays a button;
* `Image` - displays an image;
* `TextField` - displays a text field;
* etc.

## [Layouts](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/basics)

* `Row` - displays a horizontal list of items;
* `Column` - displays a vertical list of items;
* `Box` - displays a box that can contain other composables;

## State

* A composable function can have **state**;
* State in an app is any value that can change over time. 
* Any time a **state is updated**, the composable function that uses that state is **recomposed**;
* Composable functions can use the `remember` API to store an object in memory;
* `mutableStateOf` creates an observable `MutableState<T>`, which is an observable type integrated with the compose runtime;
* There are 3 ways to declare a `MutableState` object in a composable:

* `val state = remember { mutableStateOf(...) }`;
* `val value by remember { mutableStateOf(...) }`;
* `val (value, setValue) = remember { mutableStateOf(...) }`.
